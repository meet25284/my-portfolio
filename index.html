            <div id="designingskill"><p>I believe that designing for AI is not just about interfaces, but about translating intelligence into human experiences. My work focuses on making complex systems feel simple, intuitive, and beautiful — where data becomes insight, predictions feel natural, and technology quietly empowers users. Through thoughtful visuals, purposeful interactions, and a deep understanding of AI capabilities, I aim to create designs that bridge innovation and usability.</p></div>

            <div id="engineeringskill"><p>Great AI design is built on smart engineering. I focus on understanding how models, APIs, and data pipelines function — designing with technical possibilities and constraints in mind. From model response times to real-time data handling, I aim to create interfaces where intelligent systems feel intuitive, responsive, and trustworthy. For me, design and engineering aren't separate — they work together to shape seamless user experiences.</p></div>
